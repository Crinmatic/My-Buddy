# "My Buddy"
"My Buddy" is an  AI powered bot which tends to find solutions, run various tasks and give appropriate replies to humans when being triggered by saying "Hello "My Buddy" and then making it know your intents through speeches. 
"My Buddy" development started February 2021 and as at today, it has been performing well. "My Buddy" isn't only an AI bot, it is also a rule based bot which knows the right time to work on rules or to apply artificial intelligence 

## Working principle of "My Buddy"
"My Buddy" works with the RASA environment and uses python for some other preprocessing. Below shows the working principle of "My Buddy".
* It uses Intents, Entities, Slots, Lookup tables amongst others to generate user data to the finest level.
* These data extracted above would be preprocessed with some algorithms and trained using the RASA command lines.
* When a user makes a request or it detects an intent in the users speech it triggers an "Action".
* The Action file would carry out the tasks requested by the User either by giving utterences or by using a designated API to get results which would be sent to the User.

## Goals
+ To be linked with many services such as Ordering of Items from a grocery store, Making calls Etc. 
+ Act as a personal assistant to record speeches (Either through Text or Voice), convert it to text (if it were to be in voice) and create a summary.
+ To be linked with IoT devices to perform tasks like "Close Door 3, Door 4 and Open Door 5", "Switch on the pumping machine", Turn off the light in room 3".
+ To be embedded in Websites and Mobile Applications to serve as a useful service to the User to Automate tasks easily with one or two clicks.
+ To serve as an API for developers to embed in their respective applications.

## "My Buddy" services so far.
It's development just started and I've been a sole contributor, This has slowed down the progress. But so far, "My Buddy" offers these services;
+ Get Weather Updates in different locations.
+ Chitchat.
+ Search Query ( E.g, Tell me about the US Election).
+ Gives news update in different countries ( The country would be chosen by the User).

### NOTE
* The model was built on a small data. So it might not work really efficiently, More data would be added as time goes on.
